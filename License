### 4. Publish the feature image

Since this feature doesn’t require building extra OS or Python layers, you can publish a minimal image or use a very lightweight base image (or even an empty base).

If you want, I can help you write a minimal Dockerfile to build and publish your feature for GHCR.

### 5. Usage in your existing project’s devcontainer

```json
{
  "image": "your-existing-image:tag",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/forhad-h/devcontainers-python-features/fastapi-dev": "1"
  }
}
